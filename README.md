## How my project  is going to work.
 
This project is going to work just like the project 3 but this time everything is going to be done automatically by the system no need for the user to use the keyboard to enter the data or details about the zone,category and the device.The robot is going to read the data from the excel sheet that was given by the lecqure and then enter all the values.
