## Description
Testing is a crucial part of any solution and can be done from many different perspectives; the internal development team testing, business user acceptance testing (UAT), etc. There are also many different types of testing that can be conducted on a solution and user acceptance testing is usually done very manually. UAT is often included in most development lifecycles as a crucial step that acts as the ‘go/no-go’ decision maker. UAT is focused on ensuring that the input entered into the solution generates the expected output. If the solution does not generate the desired output, the solution needs to be amended and retested as the solution would generally not be published to production unless it passes all tests in UAT.  Robotic Process Automation (RPA) refers to the use of technology to mimic human tasks in the same way that a person would execute a process. This usually refers to, what we would call, ‘front-end’ or UI (User Interface) automation. RPA is often used to automate time-consuming and highly repetitive tasks to allow people the availed capacity to work on more intuitive tasks
